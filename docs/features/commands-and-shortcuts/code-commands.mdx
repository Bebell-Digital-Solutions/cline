Cline's code commands bring AI assistance directly into your editor, letting you interact with your code without leaving your workflow. With a simple right-click, you can add code to Cline, fix errors, or generate documentation.

## Available Code Commands

When you right-click on code in your editor, you'll see several Cline commands:

### Add to Cline

The "Add to Cline" command sends your selected code to the Cline chat panel. This is perfect for:

-   Asking questions about specific code snippets
-   Requesting improvements or optimizations
-   Getting explanations of complex logic

When you use this command, Cline automatically includes:

-   The file path (as a file mention)
-   The selected code with proper formatting
-   The programming language for accurate syntax highlighting

### Fix with Cline

The "Fix with Cline" command appears when you right-click on code that has errors or warnings. This command:

1. Captures the selected code
2. Identifies the errors or warnings from VSCode's diagnostics
3. Sends both to Cline with a request to fix the issues
4. Provides a solution that addresses the specific problems

This is incredibly useful for quickly resolving syntax errors, linter warnings, or type issues without having to manually describe the problem.

### Generate Documentation

The "Generate Documentation" command helps you create documentation for your code. When you select a function, class, or module and use this command, Cline:

1. Analyzes the code structure and purpose
2. Generates appropriate documentation comments
3. Follows your project's documentation style (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
4. Includes parameter descriptions, return values, and examples

## How to Use Code Commands

Using Cline's code commands is simple:

1. Select the code you want to work with
2. Right-click to open the context menu
3. Choose the appropriate Cline command
4. View the result in the Cline chat panel

You can then:

-   Ask follow-up questions
-   Request modifications to the solution
-   Apply the changes back to your code

## Code Actions

In addition to the context menu commands, Cline also integrates with VSCode's code actions system. When you see a lightbulb icon in your editor, you can click it to see available actions, including:

-   Fix with Cline
-   Explain with Cline
-   Optimize with Cline

These code actions appear contextually based on the code and any diagnostics, giving you AI assistance exactly when and where you need it.

## How It Works Under the Hood

When you use a code command, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Code Selection**: The extension captures your selected code and its context
2. **Metadata Collection**: Cline gathers important metadata:

    - File path and name
    - Programming language
    - Any associated diagnostics (errors/warnings)
    - Surrounding code context when relevant

3. **Command Processing**:

    - For "Add to Cline," the code is formatted and sent to the chat panel
    - For "Fix with Cline," the code and diagnostics are analyzed and a fix is generated
    - For "Generate Documentation," the code structure is parsed and appropriate documentation is created

4. **Integration with Chat**: The results appear in the Cline chat panel, where you can:
    - See the AI's response
    - Ask follow-up questions
    - Apply suggested changes

This seamless integration between your editor and Cline's AI capabilities makes it easy to get assistance without disrupting your coding flow.

## Tips for Effective Use

-   **Select complete logical units**: When possible, select entire functions, classes, or modules to give Cline complete context
-   **Include imports**: For language-specific help, include relevant imports so Cline understands dependencies
-   **Combine with @ mentions**: For complex issues, use code commands along with file or problem mentions for more context
-   **Use keyboard shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow by [assigning keyboard shortcuts](/features/commands-and-shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts) to common code commands

Next time you're struggling with a piece of code, try using Cline's code commands instead of switching to a separate chat interface. You'll be amazed at how much more efficient your workflow becomes when AI assistance is integrated directly into your editor.
