@ mentions allow you to include context from your workspace in your conversations with Cline. By typing "@" followed by a reference, you can bring in files, folders, problems, terminal output, git information, and even web content without leaving the chat interface.

## How to Use @ Mentions

When you type "@" in the chat input, a context menu appears showing you what you can reference:

1. Type "@" in the chat input
2. Select a category (files, folders, terminal, problems, etc.)
3. Choose the specific item you want to reference
4. Send your message as usual

## Real-world Example

Before @ mentions, whenever I hit an error, I had to:

1. Copy the error message
2. Paste it into chat
3. Copy the relevant code files
4. Paste those into chat
5. Describe how they relate

Now I just do:

```
I'm getting this error when running my app: @terminal

Here's my component code: @/src/components/Button.jsx

And the API call: @/src/api/users.js

What am I doing wrong?
```

Cline sees the full terminal output and the complete file contents, including imports and related code I might have overlooked. This means solutions are more accurate because Cline has the complete picture.

## Start Using @ Mentions

Next time you're asking Cline for help, try using @ mentions instead of copying and pasting. It's faster, provides better context, and ensures Cline has all the information needed to give you the best assistance.

Just remember: the more relevant context you provide with @ mentions, the more accurate and helpful Cline's responses will be.
