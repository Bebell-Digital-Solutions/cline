### Great within Cline: Real-time Information Access

xAI's Grok models have access to real-time information through X/Twitter integration, providing current insights into technology trends, framework updates, and development best practices. This capability is particularly valuable for agentic coding workflows, as it enables Cline to reference the latest security advisories, newly released library versions, and emerging development patterns when making architectural decisions or troubleshooting issues. For modern web development where frameworks and tools evolve rapidly, this real-time knowledge helps ensure code recommendations stay current with the latest industry standards.
