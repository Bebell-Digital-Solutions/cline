**Extended Thinking:**

Anthropic models offer an "Extended Thinking" feature, designed to give them enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. This feature allows the model to output its step-by-step thought process before delivering a final answer, providing transparency and enabling more thorough analysis for challenging prompts.

When extended thinking is in Cline, the model generates thinking content blocks that detail its internal reasoning. These insights are then incorporated into its final response. Cline users can leverage this by checking the Enable Extended Thinking box below the model selection menu after selecting a Claude Model from any provider.
