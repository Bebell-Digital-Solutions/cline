UI Refresh: Enhanced welcome screen with dynamic time-based greetings that change according to the user's local time ("Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", or "Good Evening"). Added contextual random sub-messages that differ between normal working hours and late night sessions. This UI refresh transforms Cline's interface from a technical, feature-focused experience to a personal, welcoming environment that greets users by name. Visual improvements including rounded corners and distinct color-coding for Plan/Act modes create a more modern aesthetic while improving usability through better visual distinction between different states. By shifting from a capabilities-focused introduction to a personalized greeting with the Cline logo, the experience feels more human and approachable, potentially increasing user engagement and reducing the intimidation factor for those new to AI coding assistants.
