# Summary of Changes

1. __Created a New SendButton Component__

   - Created a dedicated SendButton component in `webview-ui/src/components/chat/SendButton.tsx`
   - Implemented VSCode Codicons instead of HeroUI icons
   - Added dynamic behavior to switch between play/send and pause/cancel states

2. __Added Mode-Specific Styling__

   - Implemented custom SVG for the Resume Task state
   - Added color matching with Plan/Act mode toggle (purple for Plan mode, green for Act mode)
   - Created hover effects with brightness filter

3. __Fixed Cancel Button Issues__

   - Initially attempted to fix the Cancel button's visibility during streaming
   - Ultimately removed the Cancel button completely during streaming per request
   - Modified the condition to only show secondary buttons when not streaming

4. __Improved User Experience__

   - Added tooltip for the Resume Task state
   - Made the button 3px bigger in Resume Task state
   - Ensured proper cursor behavior during streaming

These changes have enhanced the UI with native VSCode styling while addressing the issues with the Cancel button's behavior during streaming.
